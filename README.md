# eduID.cz's WAYF/DS

This implementation of *Where Are You From* (WAYF) also known as *Discovery
Service* (DS) has been developed by *CESNET* since 2012 for *eduID.cz*
federation. The main goal is to provide federation users with WAYF supporting
both personal computers as well as modern mobile devices such as smartphones
and tablets running various operating systems (Microsoft Windows, Linux/UNIX,
macOS, iOS and Android).
